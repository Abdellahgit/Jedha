# Jedha-Project
Project about "What's the best place to be a Data Analyst in the US"


The "posting.csv" file has been pre-modified because of it's weight (over 500Mo) and couldn't be uploaded easily
The change resolve simply around deleting a column called "Description" which was the details of each job offer, but weighted about 450Mo 
The Git submit limit by defaults are 100Mo files so I prefered to do a manual tweak here 

The original file (and full folder) can be found there : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data
